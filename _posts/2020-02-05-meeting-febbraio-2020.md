### After 8: Sweet New Features in the JDK

Simon Ritter passa da Torino per il suo Italian JUG Tour.

In this session we’ll take a look at the rapid evolution of the Java platform
with the introduction of new features in each of the recent releases:
• JDK 9: Java Platform Module System
• JDK10: Local variable type inference
• JDK 11: JDK Flight Recorder
• JDK 12: Switch expressions
• JDK 13: Text blocks
• JDK 14: Records and pattern matching
What might future JDKs include? To answer that question, we’ll explore
some of the longer-term plans for Java, like project Amber, Loom and Valhalla.
